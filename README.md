My name is Joel Grabner, and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science at the University of Saint Thomas, graduating in 2024. 
As a student, I hope to achieve more experience in the profession through internships in various insurance fields and gain more knowledge by studying and passing exams. 
I am most interested in the role of an actuary because of the real-world applications that math has to the insurance industry, 
and how a monetary value is put on certain risks. 
I have since passed exam FM and am currently taking courses relating to future exams and the insurance and risk management field. 
I have basic experience with using Python, C+, and R. I am proficient in using Microsoft Excel and Access and I am interested in learning more useful coding languages. 
I will be looking for more job experiences and internship opportunities in my upcoming college years.
